# Optimization - MILP

Summary
- Collection of Jupyter notebooks and a PDF related to the optimization assignment.

What this workspace contains
- Two interactive Jupyter notebooks:
  - [Comp_assign1.ipynb](Comp_assign1.ipynb) — primary computational notebook.


Quick start
1. Install Python (3.8+) and Jupyter:
   - pip install jupyterlab ipykernel
2. Open this folder in VS Code and use the Jupyter extension, or run:
   - jupyter lab
3. Open and run cells in:
   - [Comp_assign1.ipynb](Comp_assign1.ipynb) and [facility.ipynb](facility.ipynb).
